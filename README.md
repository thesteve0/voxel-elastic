Here is the "script" for the demo
1. Load the quickstart data
2. Show it in the browser
    a. Explain that what we are seeing are images along with their metadata
    b. show predictions vs ground truth
    c. Show filtering by prediction confidence
3. Now calculate embeddings for both Alexnet and CLIP - explain we are trying to pick a foundational model to choose
4. Back in the browser,  viz those scatter plots
    a. Start with clip and highlight the cluster of food
    b. Clear selection
    c. Now visualize with Alex (they produce very different clouds)
    d. Select the cat cluster in Alex and then switch the viz to Clip and see the highlighted points
5. clear the selection again
6. Show a programmatic query view and then show how it ends up looking in the scatter plots
